## Abstract 
This proposal aims to investigate whether use of mobile swipe gestures supports the [theory of Hick's law in preference selection in the context of content personalisation on a mobile news application]. In this proposal, a background will be outline of the research this  is to be carried out, and an overview of research previously carried out in the area and to mark out how this research could be carried out in order to answer this projects research question: What is the best design pattern to adopt when cold start in personalisation for mobile content websites?

## Introduction (200)
- what this proposal is about
- what is the research question

This proposal sets out to investigate whether the use of swipe gestures can help with task of getting users to elicit personal preferences of news content in comparison to a traditional list-style approach. In this document, a background to the motivations for this research will be explain as well as an in-dept outline of the work carried out in this area. In addition, a research plan will be outlined and the methodology for carrying out this research defined. Lastly, the context for which this project will be as a case study will also be given as well as background to the platform on which this research will be carried out. 

## Research Problem

- Information overload
- Where personalisation comes in..
	- what is it?
	- why is there a need for it?
	- How is it done?
	- What has been done already in the area?
	- Briefly describe what cold start is at this point?


## Research Problem (1000)

This aim of this research is build on what has already been discovered about news personalisation and explore whether swipe-based gestures can be used to enhance the user-interface and help overcome the cold-start problem of content personalisation. 

While some believe that personalisation can be carried out effectively without user intervention (Billsus, 2000), there's more recent research to user that there is greater trust and level of engagement in a system when a user has some control of preference selection (McNee, Lam, Konstan, & Riedl, 2003)

With the rise of mobile it is becoming increasly difficult to find content this one's interests. Content recommendation systems (RS) are becoming increasing important to combat this problem. (Thurman & Schifferes, 2012)(Jørstad, Thanh, & Dustdar, 2004). RS is a one tool available to publishers to retain and grow their traffic and companies that cannot offer this service are at a real competitive disadvantage (Hindman, 2012). 

With the amount of information that is being published online everyday is becoming overwhelming. [[Personalisation is regarded   the user experience on mobile websites is becoming increasingly cluttered and ever so hard to find the relevant content [citation needed]]. Personalisation has been widely adopted by news publishers and the methods of personalisation have been documented to great extent. However much of the work carried in the area of personalisation has been in measuring the the success of various personalisation algorithms in influencing user engagement (Knijnenburg & Willemsen, 2015). 

### Research Question
 [What I am actually trying to achieve with this research?]

The following research question will be raised in order to help understand the advantages of swipe based gestures in content personalisation systems:
 
> How can swipe base user interface be user for preference selection in personalisation servi,


### Why this research is important (200)

- Recommender systems have been proven to lower the effort requirement by the user to make a decision (Xiao & Benbasat, 2007) (Bollen, Knijnenburg, Willemsen, & Graus, 2010)
- Information overload and how content personalisation solves that
- 

#### Reduce Cognitive load (200)
- performance overload
- Information overload (Hick's law)
- Choice effort  (Xiao & Benbasat, 2007)

### Hick's Law 

Hick's law asserts that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of options increase (Cao, 2013). In content websites, this ever present with the number of related links are represented to the user at the head of an article, or the number of links present to her in search results for example. This can lead to cognitive overload which is, the amount of mental activity that is required to accomplish a goal. Mental activity can include perception, memory or problem solving (Lidwell, Holden, & Butler, 2010). In user experience design, various cognitive load can be lessened in various methods such as chunking information,  recognition over recall and.


## Research Background (2000)

### Research Platform (400)

The platform that will be used a case study in for this research is The Irish Times, an independent new publisher based in Dublin. The company is 158 years old and is considered a market leader digital news publishing and produces up to 100 articles online every day. The Irish times currently offers no personalisation features to it readers, so this makes this a good opportunity to explore the topic in detail. 

As the Irish times as a case study, this new feature will be prototyped as part of the on-boarding process for new subscriber . 

### Literature Review 

#### Introduction 

This literature will examine the work done in the area of personalisation within the context of mobile news websites. Furthermore, an overview in the area of mobile swipe gestures, particular user input will be investigated. Finally, this review will conclude with gaps in research research that identify further research within the area. 

#### Personalisation in general

[What it is]
Personalisation is quickly becoming standard feature in content websites these days [Find citation]. Companies such as Amazon and Netflix have completely disrupted traditional industries with by delivering personalised experiences to their customers. 
Personalisation aims to enhance a user's experience by taking into account that users preferences, either implicitly or explicitly and display the most relevant information to that user [need citation]. Fan & Poole (2006) suggest that there are three sets of 'perspectives on personalisation' that can guide how personalisation is design. These perspectives are in relation to 1) changing the content, 2) the user interface, and 3) functionality to meet the needs of that user. Personalisation has many descriptions depending on the field in which it is being studied, in user experience personalisation can be described as:

> The understanding of the user, the user’s tasks, and the context in which the user accomplishes tasks and goals
( J. Karat, C. Marat, and J. Ukelson, 2000)

Personalisation can be carried by explicitly or implicitly input 
noting a users preferences. **Explicit personalisation** as the means of a user directly inter their user preferences to customise their reading experience. Explicit personalisation can be seen in various flavours within online new publishing, the most of which is the presentation of a 'My News' view is apparent in the BBCs mobile applications. On the contrary, **Implicit Personalisation** requires no user interaction and content is often presented without the user being aware of the profiling and how the content is being personalised to their interests. There are many examples of this, the most obvious example is google search. When you type 'news' in google the results returned will be relevant to your geolocation (Das, Datar, Garg, & Rajaram, 2007). 


Content personalisation is even more important with the rise of mobile usage [cite from PEW report]. Especially with increased 'stickiness' of Facebook and twitter, engagement time is 

- Swipe gestures in content websites? (300)

There has many research studies done in the field of personalisation [ref to a study on the work done in the area]. 
Research has revealed that that personalisation services can lead to increased engagement and loyalty of a service, reduce information overload (Fan & Poole, 2006).

#### Content personalisation in the news (200)

There has much research been  the various methods of personalising content within the domain of news publishing (Thurman & Schifferes, 2012),(Shah, Koneru, Shah, & Parimi, 2016), (Lavie, Sela, Oppenheim, Inbar, & Meyer, 2010), (Crain, 2016). Similarly researchers have carried out tests with various ways of testing personalisation within the news domain. (Banos, Katakis, Bassiliades, Tsoumakas, & Vlahavas, 2006; Li, Wang, Li, Knox, & Padmanabhan, 2011; Lin, Xie, Li, Huang, & Li, 2012).  

## Swipe based gestures

- What are swipe UI gestures?
- Official definition needed

Swipe user interfaces have become a widely established design pattern for mobile (Nilsson, 2009). 

Given the small screen space on smartphones and the contexts in which they are used, it is no surprise that users find gestures more useful to control mobile systems (Bank, 2014). Not only are mobile gestures widely adopted, Mauney, Howarth, Wirtanen, & Capra (2010) states that swipe gestures are being in the same ways across cultural differences. 

There are numerous benefits for using gesture based interactions, including less cluttered user interface and reduction in steps in the user flow (Babich, 2016). However, swipe based gestures do have an initial learning curve and sometimes an onboarding experience is needed to teach the user or to inform them that it exists (Joos, 2013). In addition, swipe based gestures comes with the need for having to give feedback to the user that the interaction was successful that this can no longer be given illustrated to through state change but by think about time, dimension and dimension of the interaction (Joos, 2013). But even in heavily distracted environments that smartphone users frequency find themselves in,  swipe swipe based gestures are considered better for input. (Negulescu, Ruiz, Li, & Lank, 2012). Usability isn't the only benefit to using swipe gestures, as van Beurden, Ijsselsteijn, & de Kort (2012) asserts that gestures can bring a more pleasure experience to an application over traditional tap based interactions.

Some apps have based their entire experience around swipe gestures. Snapchat, a social hype-sharing app for teenagers uses swipe gestures solely to navigate the application. (Verstraete, 2016). Tinder (2012) is a dating app that lets you choose single men and women through swipe logic. Combined with a card based user interface it enables the user to quickly accomplish a quickly and easily. 

#### The Cold Start Problem (200)


#### Conclusion

- The research done on user interface with in personalisation primarily focuses on the output of recommender systems and in the area of adaptive user interfaces. 

- Much of the work carried out in the area of personalisation has been in measuring the accuracy of various algorithms and how it influences user engagement (Knijnenburg & Willemsen, 2015).
